# üçÑ pwn-writeups

Binary exploitation writeups for various CTF's / pwn websites.

Not all challenges will have the full writeup but will have the exploit script - depends on what writeups I get to or what I think would be worthwhile.

List of included CTFs:

* pwnable.tw
* 1337UP 2024

What tools I use:

* Pwntools
* Pwninit
* Pwndbg
* Ghidra
* ROPgadget
